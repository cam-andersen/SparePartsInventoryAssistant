This is the activity 22. 

As acticity 22 is based on the answer for acticity 11, both of the activities are combined into program.cs
Activity 11 is placed at the top of the cs-file and activity 22 below.
This means that the improved codes in activity 22, at the bottom, blocks some of the codes overall - meaning that the code cannot run. 

This is only to show that improvements for my previous code has been evaluated and improved.
