This is the activity 22. 

As acticity 22 is based on the answer for acticity 11, both of the activities are combined into program.cs
Activity 11 is placed at the top of the cs-file and activity 22 below.
This means that the improved codes in activity 22, at the bottom, blocks some of the codes overall - meaning that the code cannot run. 

This is only to show that improvements for my previous code has been evaluated and improved.


The flowchart is drawed in hand and is attached as a scan. It is named 'flow chart activity 11 and 22'

Kindly note: the program has been updated the 23rd of November. The updates contains comment-changes to improve my own understanding of the code. As the program was created in the beginning of the course, the code is very simple and has not been updated in accordance to the coding learned later in the course.
